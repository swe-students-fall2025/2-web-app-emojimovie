A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

The NYU Clothing Exchange will be a mobile platform where students can quickly and safely trade, buy, and sell clothes, promoting sustainability and convenience on campus.

## User stories

1. As a seller, I want to list a used clothing item with photos, description of the item, preferred meetup location, and the price so I can sell and earn money.
2. As a user, I want to buy articles of clothing from other users so that I can find affordable clothes to expand my wardrobe.
3. As a Seller, I want to edit the price, description, and status of my existing listing so I can correct any mistakes, lower the price to have a quicker sale, and updating whether the item is still available.
4. As a Buyer, I want to see the seller's preferred meetup locations (e.g., "near Washington Square Park" or "Lower Manhattan") listed on the item page so that I can immediately determine the convenience of the exchange.
6. As a Buyer, I want to be able to filter listings by size, color, and clothing type so that I can narrow down results and only view items that will fit me.
7. As a user, I want to be able to just sell to people at NYU, so I am able to trade in my clothes safely with people I am familiar with
8. As a user, I want to see the status of clothes and whether they are already sold so I am able to just look at clothes that are still available
9. As a user, I want to be able to search for clothing styles that I like, so that I can save time looking for clothes.
10. As a user, I want to be able to save items that I’ve liked from sellers, so that I can easily find the clothes I want to buy in the future in a list or in a different page.
11. As a user, I want to be able to sign up using my NYU email so that I can securely participate in the marketplace.
12. As a user, I want to be able to log in using my existing credentials so I can access my profile, listings, and saved items.
13. As a user, I want to be able to view my personal profile page so I can see a summary of my active listing, past transactions, and saved items in one place.
15. As a user, I want to be able to access and edit my account settings (e.g. username, password) so I can manage my account.
16. As a buyer, I want to be able to initiate a chat with the seller so that I can ask questions about the item’s condition or negotiate the price.
17. As a user, I want to be able to exchange text messages within the app so I can discuss the final price, a meetup time, and location on or near campus.
