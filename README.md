# Web Application Exercise

A little exercise to build a web application following an agile development process. See the [instructions](instructions.md) for more detail.

## Product vision statement

The NYU Clothing Exchange will be a mobile platform where students can quickly and safely trade, buy, and sell clothes, promoting sustainability and convenience on campus.

## User stories

1. As a seller, I want to list a used clothing item with photos, description of the item, preferred meetup location, and the price so I can sell and earn money.
2. As a user, I want to buy articles of clothing from other users so that I can find affordable clothes to expand my wardrobe.
3. As a Seller, I want to edit the price, description, and status of my existing listing so I can correct any mistakes, lower the price to have a quicker sale, and updating whether the item is still available.
4. As a Buyer, I want to see the seller's preferred meetup locations (e.g., "near Washington Square Park" or "Lower Manhattan") listed on the item page so that I can immediately determine the convenience of the exchange.
5. As a Buyer, I want to be able to filter listings by size, color, and clothing type so that I can narrow down results and only view items that will fit me.
6. As a user, I want to be able to just sell to people at NYU, so I am able to trade in my clothes safely with people I am familiar with
7. As a user, I want to see the status of clothes and whether they are already sold so I am able to just look at clothes that are still available
8. As a user, I want to be able to search for clothing styles that I like, so that I can save time looking for clothes.
9. As a user, I want to be able to save items that I’ve liked from sellers, so that I can easily find the clothes I want to buy in the future in a list or in a different page.
10. As a user, I want to be able to sign up using my NYU email so that I can securely participate in the marketplace.
11. As a user, I want to be able to log in using my existing credentials so I can access my profile, listings, and saved items.
12. As a user, I want to be able to view my personal profile page so I can see a summary of my active listing, past transactions, and saved items in one place.
13. As a user, I want to list my accepted payment methods and the names of social media platforms where I’m reachable on my profile (without showing my actual username), so that potential buyers or sellers know how to transact and connect once a deal is agreed.
14. As a user, I want to be able to access and edit my account settings (e.g. username, password, profile picture) so I can manage my account.
15. As a buyer, I want to make a bid on a post so that I can negotiate the price and receive confirmation that my bid was submitted to the seller.​
16. As a seller, I want to receive real-time notifications when a buyer places a new bid, so I can promptly accept or counter the offer.
17. As a seller, I want to be able to accept or reject a buyer’s bid and notify the buyer immediately of my decision, so they know whether to proceed or consider revising their offer.​
18. As a user, I want to view the social media contact information of the other party (with their consent) after a bid is accepted, so I can reach out directly to finalize the transaction and discuss a meetup location.
